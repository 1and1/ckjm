<h2>ckjm &mdash; Chidamber and Kemerer Java Metrics</h2>
 <!-- Introduction {{{1 -->
<p>
<img src="smallpic.jpg" alt="Picture of the Java book, the metrics paper, and a measure tape" align="right" hspace="20" />
The program <em>ckjm</em> calculates Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented
metrics by processing the bytecode of compiled Java files.
The program calculates for each class the following six metrics proposed
by Chidamber and Kemerer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>WMC: Weighted methods per class</li>
<li>DIT: Depth of Inheritance Tree</li>
<li>NOC: Number of Children</li>
<li>CBO: Coupling between object classes</li>
<li>RFC: Response for a Class</li>
<li>LCOM: Lack of cohesion in methods</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition it also calculates for each class
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ce: Efferent couplings</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wrote this program out of frustration over the
<a href="../../blog/20050211/">lack</a>
of reliable programs to calculate the
Chidamber and Kemerer object-oriented metrics.
The programs I found on the web were either
incomplete (they calculated only some of the metrics),
or unreliable (they calculated results that were obviously wrong),
or extremely inefficient (they required GB of RAM and hours of processing).
<em>Ckjm</em> is mean and lean, following the Unix tradition of doing
one thing well.
It will not automatically recurse directories looking for the files
you want measured,
it does not offer a GUI (or even an XML output facility),
and it does not calculate metrics other than the six ones specified
by Chidamber and Kemerer.
However, it does this job thoroughly, and efficiently:
on a 1.6GHz Pentium-M machine it will process the 33MB of the Eclipse 3.0
jar files (19717 classes) in 95 seconds.
</p>
<p>
To run the program you simply specify the class files
(or pairs of jar/class files)
on its command line or standard input.
The program will produce on its standard output a line for each class
containing the complete name of the class and the values of its metrics.
This operation model allows the tool to be easilly extended using textual
pre- and post-processors.
</p>
<p>
From version 1.2 and onward <em>ckjm</em> can be used as an
ant task, and can also directly generate XML output.
You can post-process the XML output with XSLT to generate nice-looking
reports.
Here is a report example using
<a href="output_simple.html">simple report style</a>
and here is an example using the
<a href="output_extra.html">fancy report style</a>.
XSL files for both report styles are part of the distribution.
